For the 2023 PSU awards granted in January 2024, these outcomes were considered in the context of (among other things) the expected impacts of: regulatory capital requirements, annual stress tests, interest rates, and the U.S. / global economic and geopolitical environment, all of which affect the range of ROTCE outcomes in the medium-term. •The CMDC calibrated the upper ROTCE goal of the 2023 PSUs, representing exceptional financial performance over the 3-year performance period, at 18% or more; and the lower ROTCE threshold, representing weak financial performance over the same period, at below 6%. To this end, the CMDC believes that it has set upper and lower absolute performance thresholds that are sufficiently rigorous compared to the Firm’s current ROTCE outlook over the next 3 years.•In setting the relative ROTCE performance goals for the 2023 PSU awards, the CMDC limited above-target payout to instances in which the Firm outperforms the majority of its competitors on a relative basis, with below-target payout occurring in instances of underperformance.

During our semi-annual shareholder outreach program and discussion of our equity compensation practices, our shareholders continued to indicate a preference for more frequent requests for approval of a smaller quantity of shares. As a result, the Compensation & Management Development Committee and the Board considered this feedback in determining the number of shares to request for authorization under the 2024 Plan.The 2024 Plan would also continue to incorporate our compensation program for non-employee directors, with certain established retainers (both cash and equity) and certain limitations on future changes to those retainers.",

Burke, is independent. His tenure has allowed him to gain invaluable institutional knowledge, making him extremely effective as Lead Independent Director. Mr. Burke has been overwhelmingly supported by shareholders, receiving more than 90% of shareholder votes for each election during his tenure.•The Board empowers the Lead Independent Director role to include robust responsibilities and independent authority to provide a strong, effective counterbalance to the Chair. A Lead Independent Director is appointed when the Chair is not independent.•The proponent’s assertion that mandating an independent board chairman is best practice is without basis.

The CMDC applies:\n• ~50% weighting to its consideration of absolute and relative business results (what they have accomplished)\n• ~50% weighting to its qualitative consideration of risk, controls & conduct; client/customer/stakeholder; and teamwork &\nleadership (how they have accomplished results)\nWhile there is no single performance dimension in isolation that determines compensation, a significant shortcoming in any one\ndimension may result in downward adjustments to OC members' variable compensation, without limits.",

Burke, is independent. His tenure\nhas allowed him to gain invaluable institutional\nknowledge, making him extremely effective as Lead\nIndependent Director. Mr. Burke has been\noverwhelmingly supported by shareholders, receiving\nmore than 90% of shareholder votes for each election\nduring his tenure.\n• The Board empowers the Lead Independent Director\nrole to include robust responsibilities and independent\nauthority to provide a strong, effective counterbalance\nto the Chair. A Lead Independent Director is appointed\nwhen the Chair is not independent.\n• The proponent’s assertion that mandating an\nindependent board chairman is best practice is without\nbasis.
