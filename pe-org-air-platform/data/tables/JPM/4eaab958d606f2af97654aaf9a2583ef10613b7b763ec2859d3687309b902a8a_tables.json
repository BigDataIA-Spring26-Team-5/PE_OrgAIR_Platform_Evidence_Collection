In accordance with the Firm's compensation philosophy, the CMDC assesses OC members' performance against four broad financial and non-financial performance dimensions in a balanced and holistic way. In determining OC compensation, the CMDC considers both what progress has been made against long-term strategic objectives, and how that progress has been achieved. The CMDC applies an approximately 50% weighting to its consideration of absolute and relative business results, i.e. \"the what\", and an approximately 50% weighting to its qualitative consideration of risk, controls & conduct, clients/customers/stakeholders, and teamwork & leadership, i.e. \"the how\".While there is no single performance dimension in isolation that determines compensation, a significant shortcoming in any one dimension may, as has happened in past years, result in downward adjustments to OC members' variable compensation.
