Mr. Johnson elected to defer 100% of his 2022 Cash Retainer into the Interest Fund in the Directors’ Deferred Compensation Plan. Ms. Ayotte, Mr. Calhoun, Mr. MacLennan, Ms. Reed-Klages and Ms. Schwab elected to defer a portion of their equity award that vested on March 1, 2022, into the Directors’ Deferred Compensation Plan.

Additionally in 2022, the Caterpillar Foundation also provided a 2:1 match program for a period of time in support of the Foundation’s 70th Anniversary and Giving Tuesday that allowed participants to donate up to $500 to be matched at a 2:1 ratio. The amounts listed include Charitable Foundation matching gifts as follows: Mr. White $11,000. As part of CATPAC’s PACMATCH program, Caterpillar Inc. will contribute to up to four charities on behalf of eligible members who contribute at the suggested giving level.

(4) Total fees earned or paid in 2022 include pro-rated Cash Retainer and/or Cash Stipends for directors who ceased board service or transitioned between committee chair positions over the course of the year. The cash compensation for Ms. Ayotte, Mr. Calhoun, Ms. Reed-Klages and Mr. Wilkins reflect pro-ration of chair stipends for the transition of roles on June 8, 2022. (5) Mr. White did not stand for re-election, thereby concluding his board service June 8, 2022. His cash compensation includes pro-ration to the date his board service ceased."

          "(1) Values in this column include the value of personal aircraft usage based on Caterpillar’s incremental cost per flight hour, including the weighted average variable operating cost of fuel, oil, aircraft maintenance, landing and parking fees, related ground transportation, catering and other smaller variable costs. Mr. Umpleby and the Company have a time-sharing lease agreement, pursuant to which certain costs associated with personal flights are reimbursed by Mr. Umpleby to the Company in accordance with the agreement. The 2022 amount listed includes personal use of corporate aircraft as follows: Mr. Umpleby $77,457, Mr. Bonfield $13,344, Mr. De Lange $56,242 and Mr. Creed $12,216. Values in this column also include the value of personal use of executive ground transportation service based on Caterpillar’s incremental cost per mile and trip hour, or as invoiced by a third-party service provider. The 2022 amount listed includes personal ground transportation usage as follows: Mr. Umpleby $299, Mr. Bonfield $1,083, Ms. Johnson $1,776, Mr. De Lange $1,836 and Mr. Creed $204. (2) Amounts reported for personal security include the cost for services provided by outside security providers for installation, monitoring and maintenance of home security and smart home services and for reputation and identity theft protection. The incremental cost associated with the security services is determined based upon the amounts paid to these outside service providers. (3) Values in this column include the cost for executive physicals and financial planning and tax preparation services. The incremental cost associated with these services is determined based upon the amounts paid to the approved service providers. Values in this column also include relocation benefits provided to the NEOs as follows: Mr. Umpleby $145,213 (including a tax gross-up of $33,883), Mr. Bonfield $246,104 (including a tax gross-up of $46,722), Ms. Johnson $211,168 (including a tax gross-up of $37,086), Mr. De Lange $401,004 (including a tax gross-up of $52,211) and Mr. Creed $40,302 (including a tax gross-up of $15,837). All of the NEOs, except Mr. Creed, relocated to the Irving, Texas, area in connection with the Company’s relocation of its global headquarters and received benefits in 2022. Mr. Creed, who relocated to the Irving area prior to the global headquarters move, also received benefits in 2022. All NEOs were subject to the same policies and received the same benefits as other U.S.-based management employees who experienced a U.S. domestic relocation for the Company. The incremental cost for these relocation benefits is determined based on the actual costs or charges incurred. Mr. De Lange was previously an International Service Employee (ISE), and the amount reported also includes tax preparation fees of $1,536 (including a tax gross-up of $36) incurred in 2022 related to his ISE service in accordance with the Company’s tax equalization policy for ISEs."

          "(1) Upon his initial hire with Solar Turbines Inc, a wholly owned subsidiary of Caterpillar, on July 7, 1980, Mr. Umpleby became eligible to participate in the Solar Turbines Inc. Retirement Plan (Solar RP) and the Solar Turbines Incorporated Managerial Retirement Objective Plan (Solar MRO). Mr. Creed participates in the Caterpillar, Inc. Retirement Income Plan (RIP). The Solar RP was merged into RIP as of January 1, 2015; however, all benefit and eligibility provisions of Solar RP remain unchanged. The RIP is a noncontributory U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan and the Solar MRO is a U.S. non-qualified pension plan. Mr. Bonfield, Ms. Johnson and Mr. De Lange do not participate in a pension plan. (2) Mr. Umpleby has more than 42 years of service with the Company and meets the early retirement eligibility requirement of age 55 with at least ten years of service. The Solar RP was merged into RIP as of January 1, 2015; however, all benefit and eligibility provisions of Solar RP remain unchanged. The total benefit formula for the Solar RP is 60 percent of final average salary prorated for years of service less than 25 minus 65 percent of the monthly Social Security benefit. Final average salary is the average base salary for the highest consecutive 36-month period during the 120-month period prior to the determination date. The Solar MRO provides a benefit under the same benefit formula but includes base salary and annual cash incentive pay. Amounts payable under both Solar RP and Solar MRO are based upon a maximum of 25 years of service. Mr. Creed has more than 25 years of service with the Company. The Traditional benefit formula for the RIP is 1.5 percent of final average salary times years of service as of the freeze date of the plan (up to 35). Final average salary is the average base and incentive salary for the 5 highest 12-month periods during the 120-month period prior to the determination date. Mr. Creed does not currently meet early retirement eligibility requirement criteria as defined under RIP but would be eligible upon attainment of 30 years of service or age 55, whichever comes first. The employees’ annual retirement income benefits under the RIP and Solar RP are restricted by the Internal Revenue Code limitations and the excess benefit is paid from the Solar MRO for Mr. Umpleby. Solar MRO is not funded. (3) The present value of accumulated benefits payable is determined assuming commencement on the NEO’s earliest unreduced retirement date using a discount rate of 5.35% and the PRI-2012 White Collar separate annuitant and non-annuitant mortality table with a load factor of 93.6% and projected forward using Scale MP-2021 fully generational. Mr. Umpleby satisfies the plans’ unreduced early retirement criteria, attainment of age 62 with at least 10 years of service. Mr. Creed does not satisfy unreduced early retirement criteria; his benefit is valued at his normal retirement age. (4) Mr. Umpleby’s pension benefit is based on the average of the highest consecutive 36 months of pensionable earnings in the 120-month period prior to the determination date of December 31, 2019, the date on which the Solar RP and Solar MRO were frozen for all sunset employees. Mr. Creed’s pension benefit under RIP is based on the average of the 5 highest 12-month periods within the 120-month period preceding the determination date of December 31, 2010, the date on which RIP was frozen for all non-sunset employees. Pensionable earnings under these plans include base salary and annual cash incentive pay. Although Mr. Umpleby and Mr. Creed no longer accrue additional benefits under these plans, the present value of the accumulated benefit as reported may increase or decrease each year based on the actuarial and interest rate assumptions used to calculate the benefits for financial reporting purposes."

          "(1) The Supplemental Deferred Compensation Plan (SDCP) is a non-qualified deferred compensation plan, which effectively replaced the Supplemental Employees’ Investment Plan (SEIP) and Deferred Employees’ Investment Plan (DEIP). (2) SDCP allows eligible U.S. employees, including all NEOs, to voluntarily defer a portion of their base salary and annual incentive pay into the plan and receive a Company matching contribution. Amounts deferred by executives in 2022 for base salary and annual incentive pay are included in the “2022 Summary Compensation Table.” Eligible U.S. employees, including all NEOs, also receive an annual non-elective contribution to SDCP by the Company regardless of employee deferrals. Annual non-elective contributions and/or matching contributions to SDCP made by Caterpillar in 2022 are included in the “2022 All Other Compensation Table” under the “Company Contributions SDCP” column. SDCP participants may elect to receive a lump sum payment, or installment payments payable for up to 15 years, following their separation from service. (3) Aggregate earnings comprise interest, dividends, capital gains and appreciation/depreciation of notional investment results. The investment choices available to the participant mirror those of the Company’s 401(k) plans. (4) Amounts in this column include the following amounts that have been reported in the “Summary Compensation Table” for the years 2020–2022 as follows: Mr. Umpleby $2,054,986, Mr. Bonfield $842,048, Ms. Johnson $1,072,979, Mr. De Lange $838,512, Mr. Creed $423,282."
