This year’s meeting will be held virtually. We will provide an update on the company’s performance and ask for your vote on several business-related items. Information on participating in this year’s shareholder meeting is on page 83. Please review this proxy statement to learn more about your board of directors, our governance practices, compensation programs and philosophy, and other key items. Your vote is important. We encourage you to vote your shares by virtually attending the annual meeting, by voting online, by telephone or by mail. I would like to recognize Dan Dickinson, who has decided to not stand for re-election. Dan has served as a director since 2006, including as chairman of the Audit Committee from 2019-2025. The board of directors is very grateful to Dan for his valuable contributions and many years of dedicated and excellent service. We also welcome our newest board members, Nazzic Keene and Joe Creed. Nazzic is the former chief executive officer of Science Applications International Corporation and joined the board on November 1, 2024. Joe is assuming the role of chief executive officer of Caterpillar on May 1, 2025 and is joining the board on the same date. As we celebrate our 100th anniversary, I’d like to thank our global team for their commitment to serving our customers. It’s been an honor and privilege to serve as chief executive officer for the past eight years. I have great confidence in Joe and the entire executive office to lead our global team as Caterpillar embarks upon our second century of helping our customers build a better, more sustainable world. In order to ensure an orderly leadership transition, the board has asked me to serve as executive chairman. In this role, I will support Joe and the board to facilitate a smooth transition. Thank you to our shareholders for your ongoing investment in and support of Caterpillar."

          "On behalf of the board of directors, thank you for your investment in Caterpillar and for trusting us to oversee your interests. I write to also express my sincere gratitude to Caterpillar’s employees and management, who continue to drive profitable growth of our company. You are at the center of the company’s success, and your dedication to serving our customers, implementing our strategy and adhering to our values is significant and impressive. I am honored that the independent directors have entrusted me to help guide the board in its independent oversight of the company over the past three years. Ensuring that your diverse and accomplished board is well-informed about Caterpillar’s business performance is a critical focus area for me as presiding director. Throughout 2024, we had regular discussions with management, which included reviewing the company’s performance, corporate strategy, significant business initiatives, capital allocation priorities, and business development opportunities. I personally worked closely with our outgoing and incoming chief executive officers to maintain effective working relationships between the independent directors and Caterpillar’s management. I also take very seriously the responsibility of reviewing and supporting the effectiveness and independence of your board of directors. Succession planning is one of the most important responsibilities of our board. We understand the importance of strong stewardship, leadership continuity and talent development—both at the board and management level. In April 2025, we announced the appointment of Joe Creed as chief executive officer as a result of an intentional, robust, methodical and multi-year, succession planning process. Jim Umpleby was appointed executive chairman and will continue to provide counsel to Joe and the board to ensure a smooth transition of leadership. We are deeply grateful to Jim for his leadership and appreciate the outstanding results he achieved during his tenure. His impact on our customers, dealers, shareholders and employees will continue for years to come. Joe is a proven leader with significant experience in Caterpillar’s global businesses. The board is confident that Joe will continue Caterpillar’s successful journey and continue to position us for long-term profitable growth. In 2024, I personally met with many of our largest shareholders alongside senior Caterpillar management. Those meetings have been an invaluable part of my tenure as presiding director and have allowed me to better understand shareholders’ interests and share their perspectives with the board during topical discussions and decision making. Thank you – our shareholders – for your ongoing investment and support of Caterpillar as we continue to execute our enterprise strategy for long-term profitable growth and create shareholder value. We encourage you to vote your shares at the annual meeting."
