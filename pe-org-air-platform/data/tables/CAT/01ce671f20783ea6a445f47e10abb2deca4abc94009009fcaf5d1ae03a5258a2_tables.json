I write to also express my sincere gratitude to Caterpillar’s employees and management, who continue to drive sustained growth across the enterprise. You are at the center of the Company’s success, and your dedication to serving our customers, implementing our strategy and adhering to our values is significant and impressive. I am honored that the independent directors have entrusted me to help guide the Board in its independent oversight of the Company over the past two years. Ensuring that your diverse and accomplished Board is well-informed about Caterpillar’s business performance is a critical focus area for me as Presiding Director. Throughout 2023, we had regular discussions with management, which included reviewing the Company’s performance, corporate strategy, significant business initiatives, capital allocation priorities, and business development opportunities. I have personally worked closely with our Chairman & CEO to maintain effective working relationships between the independent directors and Caterpillar’s management. I also take very seriously the responsibility of reviewing and supporting the effectiveness and independence of your Board of Directors. In 2023, I personally met with many of our largest shareholders alongside senior Caterpillar management. Those meetings have been an invaluable part of my tenure as Presiding Director and have allowed me to better understand shareholders’ interests and share their perspectives with the Board during topical discussions and decision making. Thank you—our shareholders—for your ongoing investment and support of Caterpillar as we continue to execute our enterprise strategy for long-term profitable growth and create shareholder value. We encourage you to vote your shares at the Annual Meeting."
