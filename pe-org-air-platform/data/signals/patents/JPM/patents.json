      "abstract": "Systems and methods for identifying and remediating architecture design defects are disclosed. In one aspect, a method includes generating a new architecture graph pattern based on an architecture design document of an evaluated architecture; determining a model graph pattern, wherein a shape of the model graph pattern is similar to a shape of the architecture graph pattern; determining, based on a comparison of the shape of the model graph pattern with the shape of the new architecture graph pattern, that the new architecture graph pattern includes a design defect; generating, based on the shape of the model graph pattern, a remediated graph pattern; and determining, based on the differences between the remediated graph pattern and the new architecture graph pattern, a suggested remedial change to the architecture design document.",
